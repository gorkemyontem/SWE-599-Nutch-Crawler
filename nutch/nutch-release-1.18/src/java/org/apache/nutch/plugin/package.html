The Nutch {@link org.apache.nutch.plugin.Pluggable Plugin} System.
<p>
<b>The Nutch Plugin System provides a way to extend nutch functionality</b>.
A large part of the functionality of Nutch are provided by plugins:
All of the parsing, indexing and searching that nutch does is actually
accomplished by various plugins.
</p><p>
In writing a plugin, you're actually providing one or more extensions of the
existing extension-points (<i>hooks</i>).
The core Nutch extension-points are themselves defined in a plugin,
the <code>nutch-extensionpoints</code> plugin.
Each extension-point defines an interface that must be implemented by the
extension. The core extension-points and extensions available in Nutch are
listed in the {@link org.apache.nutch.plugin.Pluggable} interface.
